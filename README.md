# NLW eSports React

This app was developed using Vite to create the boilerplate to start a React application and many other techs. It was made to create ads for people play duo games. For example:
A person create an ad and then the other one interested in the same game connects to this person and add him to Discord.
It's using the backend created at the nlw-esports-backend repository, check there if you want more information.

## Tech Stack
